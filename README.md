This is a small server-sided mod that nerfs saturation healing to only heal half a heart every second instead of a full heart. This is intended to balance out high saturation foods so you don't heal super fast, but still have the boosted regeneration from saturation.

I consider this to be a more balanced version of Bedrock Edition's healing, meeting a good middlepoint.
